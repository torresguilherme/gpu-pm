# gpu-pm
[WIP] photon mapper for GPU using vulkan

this is very incomplete, i do not have a deadline to finish this and i advise against trying to use this software for now.

since this is free software you can build upon this, but let's be honest you probably don't want to. also this has no warranty so if your gpu explodes or something, sucks to be you.

# todo list

- create vulkan pipeline

- attempt to render something

# requirements for building

- assimp (>= 5.0.0)

- glm (>= 0.9.9)

- vulkan compatible device (>= 1.1)

- meson (use a reasonably recent version idfk)

- ninja (you can use other backends for meson, i like using ninja but if you do something else that's your problem)

- some C++ compiler
